# Our Places Setup Instructions

1. Clone both the client and server repos
2. Create a new MySQL database locally called "our_places_db"
3. "npm run full" in server to run seed files and migrations
4. "npm start" in client
5. If pulling from an older commit (before 11/04), navigate to /landing in order to see landing page and begin navigating the website
6. Sign up for an account and then log in with that account
7. Once logged in, usually you would ask your friends to invite you to a group. To simulate this, go to the user_group table in MySQL workbench/TablePlus and add yourself to group with group_id 1
8. Refresh the page and click the group to enter, and continue exploring the website!
